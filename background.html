                    <p>
                        Like how in our daily lives, we use base 10 to represent our numbers, computers use base 2, also
                        known as binary. For example, the number 123 to us is 100 + 20 + 3, or 1 * 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0. 
                        Binary works the same way. If we have some binary number 100, then this is 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^1. 
                        To formalize this idea, we number the significance / place of the digits from right to left as 0, 1, 2, 
                        and so on. Then, for each place, we multiply the value at that place by our base (whether that is 2 or 10) 
                        to the power of it's significance number. So, the digit 1 in the 2nd significance place in binary would be 
                        1 * 2 ^ 2 = 4.

                    <p>
                        That's right! Our computer also represents letters, which are called "characters" as numbers. Specifically, 
                        there is a conversion method called ASCII. <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/" target=_blank>
                        http://www.asciitable.com/</a> is a great reference for determining which characters map to which numbers. 
                        Our converter takes the numbers of each of the characters of your message (including space and punctuation) 
                        and converts these numbers into binary. Specifically, we make sure that each character corresponds to 8 digits 
                        of binary by adding leading 0s if needed. That way, our decoder knows which digits correspond to which 
                        characters. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, this is also why our encoder doesn't support non-ASCII characters. If we convert the characters 
                        numbers, then try to convert it back, it might give us different characters back. This is because non-ASCII 
                        characters have number codes that are greater than 127, which is the largest number we can represent with 7 
                        bits (each ASCII character is 7 bits).
